Hi, Iâ€™m [Alex](https://infosec.exchange/@alexhaydock). ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as a Security Engineer in the UK.

In my spare time, I currently help to build Tor & DNS infrastructure with [Emerald Onion](https://emeraldonion.org/).

I've also been working on running my own publicly-advertised IP network as a hobby, [AS215768](https://as215768.net/). If you're also running a hobbyist network and interested in peering with me or something else, please do get in touch!

More recently, I've been [maintaining some packages](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/users/alexhaydock) in Fedora. I'm hoping to get more involved in the future.
