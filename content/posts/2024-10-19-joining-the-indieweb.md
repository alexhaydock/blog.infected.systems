Hi, I'm [Alex](https://infosec.exchange/@alexhaydock). Welcome to my new home on the web!

### The IndieWeb
This post will probably be quite a short one, but I wanted something which would serve as an introduction to this new site which I've spun up to act as my entrypoint to the IndieWeb.

I've been watching the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) develop for some time now, along with the [Fediverse](https://www.fediverse.to/), and I figured it was finally time to get in on the action.

I like the idea of seeing a more distributed, less centralised web develop where people own the content that they create, and control their own space on the web.

Similarly, I've been a fan of using RSS feeds to follow stuff I'm interested in for about as long as I've been using the internet. I've often wondered if we'd have a slightly more decentralised web today if it weren't for the death of Google Reader all those years ago. Either way, you can enjoy this blog in a nice decentralised way by [grabbing the RSS feed here](/index.xml).

### Hugo & smol
I'm writing this blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a great open source static site generator. It's based on the very nice [smol](https://github.com/colorchestra/smol) theme.

I'd like to say I picked this theme based on the features in the README -- such as the lack of JavaScript, lack of any external dependencies, and automatic dark-mode switching. But in truth I was mostly swayed by the simplicty. There's plenty of very nice looking modular Hugo themes with more functionality, but my web-dev skills are not a strong spot. As soon as I start needing to install `yarn` and `npm` and mess with Node.js to make minor tweaks, unfortunately I'm completely lost...

There are a few tweaks I want to make going forward, and I'm hoping that choosing a simple theme means I've reduced the steepness of that learning curve.

### Future content
My hope for this blog is to post a range of things related to free software, security, and just general homelab-style stuff.

In the past I've been preoccupied with ensuring blog posts are as polished as possible before unleashing them on the world. It's nice to post well-refined content, but that just led to me posting far less and having a folder brimming with draft posts which were never "good enough" to see the light of day.

With that in mind, what I can promise you this time is _pure unbridled mediocrity_. This means hopefully reasonably frequent short-form posts which will focus on things I learned recently, interesting bugs I've hit, random observations, that kind of thing. They might not be as good as fully-polished posts, but it means I'll actually post them, so there's that.

I'm a little wary of promising anything too specific in case I don't have the time to follow through, but I already have a good idea for a bunch of posts next month. I'm planning a series titled 'No NAT November' which will chronicle the chaos I cause by completely turning off IPv4 connectivity in my home network for the month, and all the lovely challenges I end up hitting along the way.

Until next time :)
