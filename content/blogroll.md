This is my /blogroll [slashpage](https://slashpages.net/). It's a list of other sites/blogs that I read or follow. This is something I've seen gaining traction across the IndieWeb and I've found the blogrolls that other folk have put together quite useful so I figured I'd join in.

> _Having a blog roll is a way of giving back to the blogs you enjoy. People who visit your site may be interested in reading similar content. By having a blog roll, visitors can easily find similar websites that they may want to read._ -- [IndieWeb Wiki](https://indieweb.org/blogroll)

The date at the top of this page reflects the last time I updated this page.

Blogs I like:
* [Ariadne Conill](https://ariadne.space/) - Alpine and Chainguard contributor. Plenty of insightful observations about security in FOSS.
* [Benjojo](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/) - Networking and BGP fun.
* [Filippo Valsorda](https://words.filippo.io/) - Low-level cryptography and other interesting stuff in that area. A good chunk of this goes over my head, but I find myself learning a lot.
* [Jamie Tanna](https://www.jvt.me/kind/articles/) - Insightful FOSS and IndieWeb focused thoughts. Inspired this very page by [introducing me to SlashPages](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2024/10/15/slashes/).
* [Jessie Frazelle](https://blog.jessfraz.com/) - Interesting observations about open source firmware, BMC stuff, and early-boot security.
* [muffn_](https://blog.muffn.io/) - Homelab fun.
* [Neil Brown](https://neilzone.co.uk/) - Personal blog of UK-based internet and telecoms lawyer with a heavy FOSS/homelab type focus.
* [Pid Eins](https://0pointer.net/blog/) - Lennart Poettering (creator of systemd)'s blog. Especially interesting if you're into the latest developments in systemd.

Video feeds / YouTube channels:
* [apalrd's adventures](https://www.youtube.com/@apalrdsadventures/videos) - Great channel with a homelab focus. Extremely useful if you're into Proxmox.
